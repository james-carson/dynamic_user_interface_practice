# dynamic_user_interface_practice

A quick exercise from The Odin Project that tasked me with creating a JS dropdown menu and image carousel.

[Here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-dynamic-user-interface-interactions) are the instructions (login required)

The dropdown menu was quite simple as I have plenty of practise with this previously.

The image carousel was much tricker. I originally thought that the easiest way would be to append divs/images depending on the index of the slide, but the instructions specified to do it in a way that resembled one of those old kids' toys with a viewfinder, that slid along one every time to show a new image. I understand why now, as the aliding animation can be main to look like it really is 'sliding', rather than fading in or out.

Good practise, and I am sure that I will be using these techniques in my upcoming Weather App project!
